6) It looks like github puts it in 2 folders for some reason so when you're trying to load the folder, double click the first folder ![image](https://github.com/shmalish/Garmin-Menstural-Cycle-Tracker/assets/89220456/b4565ec6-b929-4ba2-9468-33680c77302e) ![image](https://github.com/shmalish/Garmin-Menstural-Cycle-Tracker/assets/89220456/761a3013-db05-4a30-ab52-bb251a805b5b) and then that is the folder that should be opened ![image](https://github.com/shmalish/Garmin-Menstural-Cycle-Tracker/assets/89220456/0e1adf5b-b89c-448b-bf54-5d4e256d0612)

This tool was a suggestion from a friend who told me that Garmin does not account for these things in their calendar but is something that heavily impacts athletes across the globe. Hopefully it helps.
